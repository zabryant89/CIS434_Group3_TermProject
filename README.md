## Project Selection
Just put your initials next to the item you would like to work on (feel free to vote for up to 2 different ideas).  I did not include the Chess game project because we have at least 1 group member that doesn't know how to play chess.

1. Support Ticketing System (MM - I have used a ticketing system at my previous internship)
2. 4-Way Traffic Light - ZB - JD - BM
3. Ordering System - JD - SO - MM - BM
4. Order form management system - NY - SO

The group has decided on the ordering system.  Google Drive link to our rough draft for task list (courtesy of Sarah): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dOELwiwpiYFfZ2WXYEsrxJHZd59Wg-sOU9ieZ-ShWjw/edit
