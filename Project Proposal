Abstract - (Mustafa Muhammad)
	Our group will be creating the Ordering System which is Project 4. Through this application users will be able to order food at a diner, call service, make 
  configurations to their order during prep time, and other adjustments as necessary. By being a member of the restaurant users will be able to use VIP points 
  provided as a program on a case by case basis depending on each individual program. Additional features include users being able to adjust appointment times, 
  see a menu, and checkout all through the application with a graphical interface. In short, users will have a fully functioning web application at their fingertips 
  which will allow them to order food and perform other needed functionalities at a restaurant. The project will be divided up into various tasks pertaining to each 
  individual’s skill set and desires suited for them. Tasks can be done in teams depending on the nature of the subject. All members will be able to view the source 
  code through a Github repository and communicate with each other through email or a Discord server. Weekly or bi-weekly meetings will be conducted to ensure proper 
  accordance with our project timeline and that everyone is on track to meet deadlines in May. Tasks that are needed to be completed for final submission of this project
  have been broken down into a modular format so that each group member can communicate and see how said tasks shall be distributed amongst one another. 
  Throughout the process the TA Shenthan or Professor Essa will be contacted if we need to ask questions or request specifications for the project. Using what is 
  taught in the coursework or group will utilize software engineering practices to ensure proper completion of the project at hand. Lastly, a final presentation will
  be given to show our finished product.
  

Methodology - (Jovan Djordjevic / )
	As previously stated, we will be using React to build a web application for our ordering system. Node.js will be used to handle the backend portion of the web
app. To create our initial design, we primarily will be using HTML and CSS. We all have experience using these languages due to our previous project in CIS 434, so
there should be at most minimal issues while working with them. Any additional updates to the interface could also be implemented with JavaScript but likely will not
be needed. At the moment, we have created a temporary template that will be referenced once we begin developing the web app. We have some ideas to store all of the
data that will be used in our project, including using some databases such as MySQL, Firebase, or simply implementing the JavaScript LocalStorage function throughout
the application. As we build our application, we will be making sure to call back to the method we use to store our data to be sure that all the data can be saved
efficiently.
